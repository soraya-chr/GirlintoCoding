<p>Hi there,<br>I'm a Computing student, my name is Soraya, I'm 19 years old from Spain, originally from Morocco.I started learning computing in 2017.I really enjoy designing designing and developing websites and apps. So here is my very first website made from scratch.<br>I will be sharing with you my day-to-day on the blog section, I love traveling so you will find some amazing adventure too! One of my hobbies was and still is drawing, just recently I started learning 3D animation, so I will be sharing some of animations too, hopefully.<br>As you know or maybe you don't, there aren't much girls/women into Computing however, it was not like that years ago, I made some research about this amazing women and decided to share them with you and the amazing women we have now a day in this field.<br>I guess this is everything!<br>Hope you enjoy my website.</p>
